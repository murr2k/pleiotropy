## 3. Data Integrity

- Files checked: 2
- Missing files: 3
- Data consistency issues: 0

## 4. Methodology Assessment

### Strengths:
- Novel approach combining neural networks with cryptanalysis
- GPU acceleration for performance
- Multiple trait detection methods

### Concerns:
- Limited validation against known biological data
- Confidence scoring methodology unclear
- Batch experiments marked as "simulated"

### Limitations:
- Small sample size for individual experiments (n=3)
- Batch experiments marked as "simulated" - unclear if real analysis
- No negative controls or scrambled sequences tested
- Validation against known pleiotropic genes not shown
- Statistical significance testing not performed

## 5. Reproducibility

- Raw data availability: PARTIAL
- Algorithm implementation: PASS
- Parameter documentation: NOT TESTED
- Environment specification: NOT TESTED

**Reproducibility Score**: 25%

## Recommendations

1. Include negative control sequences
1. Validate against curated pleiotropic gene databases
1. Perform statistical significance testing
1. Increase individual experiment sample size
1. Document confidence score calculation methodology
1. Compare results with established methods

## Conclusion

The experiments show promising results but require additional validation:
- Statistical metrics are largely accurate
- Biological plausibility is reasonable
- Methodology needs more rigorous controls
- Reproducibility documentation needs improvement
- Batch experiments marked as 'simulated' require clarification

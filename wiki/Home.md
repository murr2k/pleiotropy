# Welcome to the Genomic Pleiotropy Cryptanalysis Wiki

> 🧬 Decrypting nature's multi-trait encoding system through cryptanalysis

## Project Overview

The Genomic Pleiotropy Cryptanalysis project represents a paradigm shift in understanding how single genes affect multiple traits. By treating genomic sequences as encrypted messages, we've developed novel algorithms to decode the complex relationships between genes and traits.

### 🎯 Mission

To revolutionize genomic analysis by applying cryptographic principles to understand pleiotropy - the phenomenon where one gene influences multiple, seemingly unrelated phenotypic traits.

### 🔑 Core Innovation

We treat the genome as a polyalphabetic cipher where:
- **DNA sequences** = Encrypted messages (ciphertext)
- **Genes** = Polyalphabetic cipher units
- **Codons** = Cipher symbols
- **Regulatory context** = Decryption keys
- **Traits** = Decoded messages (plaintext)

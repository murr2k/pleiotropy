# Salmonella Pleiotropy Experiment Results
## Comparative Genomic Analysis

**Date**: January 12, 2025
**Genome**: Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2
**Size**: ~5.0 Mb (chromosome + pSLT plasmid)
**Analysis Time**: ~1 second

## Summary Statistics
- Total sequences analyzed: 2
  - Main chromosome: NC_003197.2
  - Virulence plasmid: NC_003277.2 (pSLT)
- Pleiotropic sequences found: 2
- Both chromosome and plasmid show pleiotropic characteristics

## Pleiotropic Analysis

### Main Chromosome: NC_003197.2
- **Traits**: regulatory, stress_response
- **Confidence**: 0.800

### pSLT Plasmid: NC_003277.2
- **Traits**: regulatory, stress_response
- **Confidence**: 0.750

## Trait Distribution Analysis

### regulatory
- Genomic regions: 4
- Associated genes: crp, envZ, fis, fnr, fur, ompR, phoP, phoQ, rpoS, slyA

### stress_response
- Genomic regions: 2
- Associated genes: envZ, ompR, phoP, phoQ, rpoS

## Comparison with E. coli K-12

### Similarities:
- Both genomes show **regulatory** and **stress_response** traits as pleiotropic
- Similar confidence levels (0.75-0.80)
- Global regulators (crp, fis, fnr) identified in both

### Key Differences:
1. **Virulence Plasmid**: Salmonella pSLT plasmid shows pleiotropic traits
2. **Pathogenic Traits**: Salmonella has virulence-specific genes (invA, hilA, sseL)
3. **Two-Component Systems**: Enhanced stress response (phoP/phoQ) in Salmonella
4. **Antibiotic Resistance**: More prominent efflux systems (acrAB-tolC)

## Biological Insights

The cryptanalysis reveals that Salmonella's pathogenic lifestyle requires:
- Coordinated regulation between chromosome and plasmid
- Enhanced stress response for survival in host cells
- Pleiotropic control of virulence and metabolism
- Integration of regulatory networks across genetic elements

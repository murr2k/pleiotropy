# Semiprime Factorization Repair Report

## Executive Summary

The original implementation contained a fundamental mathematical error where the test number 100822548703 was incorrectly claimed to be the product of two 6-digit primes (316907 × 318089). This report documents the repair process and the corrected implementation.

## Mathematical Error Analysis

### Original Claim (INCORRECT)
- **Claimed**: 100822548703 = 316907 × 318089
- **Actual Product**: 316907 × 318089 = 100804630723 (different number!)
- **True Factorization**: 100822548703 = 17 × 139 × 4159 × 10259 (4 prime factors)

The number 100822548703 is NOT a semiprime (product of exactly two primes), but rather has four prime factors.

### Verification
```python
# Python verification
>>> 316907 * 318089
100804630723  # Not equal to 100822548703!

>>> # Actual factorization of 100822548703
>>> factors = [17, 139, 4159, 10259]
>>> product = 1
>>> for f in factors: product *= f
>>> product
100822548703  # Correct!
```

## Corrected Implementation

### 1. New Semiprime Module (`src/semiprime_factorization.rs`)
- Implements algorithms specifically for semiprimes (numbers with exactly 2 prime factors)
- Includes primality testing using Miller-Rabin algorithm
- Two factorization methods:
  - Trial division (optimized with 6k±1 wheel)
  - Pollard's rho algorithm (for larger factors)
- Validates that results have exactly 2 prime factors

### 2. Valid Test Cases
Using actual semiprimes (verified products of two primes):
```rust
// Small semiprimes
15 = 3 × 5
77 = 7 × 11

// Large semiprimes (6-digit prime products)
100000899937 = 100003 × 999979
100015099259 = 100019 × 999961
100038898237 = 100043 × 999959
```

### 3. CUDA Implementation (`src/cuda/semiprime_cuda.rs`)
- Parallel trial division on GPU
- Optimized for GTX 2070 architecture
- Batch processing for multiple numbers
- Expected speedup: 10-40x for large batches

### 4. Comprehensive Testing
- **Correctness Tests**: Verify all factorizations are accurate
- **Performance Tests**: Ensure timing requirements are met
- **Rejection Tests**: Verify non-semiprimes are correctly rejected
- **CPU/CUDA Consistency**: Ensure both implementations give same results

## Key Features of Repaired Implementation

### 1. Mathematical Correctness
- Only accepts numbers that are products of exactly 2 primes
- Rejects numbers with 1, 3, or more prime factors
- Validates all factorizations by checking primality and product

### 2. Performance Optimization
- Small numbers (<1000): < 1ms
- Medium numbers (<10^6): < 10ms
- Large numbers (>10^10): < 100ms
- CUDA acceleration: 10-40x speedup for batches

### 3. Algorithm Selection
- Trial division for small to medium factors
- Pollard's rho for large factors
- Automatic algorithm selection based on number size

### 4. Error Handling
- Clear error messages for non-semiprimes
- Detailed timing information
- Verification of all results

```rust
#[cfg(feature = "cuda")]
use pleiotropy_rust::cuda::semiprime_cuda::factorize_semiprime_cuda_batch;

let numbers = vec![100000899937, 100015099259, 100038898237];
let results = factorize_semiprime_cuda_batch(&numbers).unwrap();
```

## Conclusion

The implementation has been completely repaired with:
1. ✅ Mathematically correct algorithms
2. ✅ Valid test data (actual semiprimes)
3. ✅ Comprehensive error handling
4. ✅ CPU and CUDA implementations
5. ✅ Extensive testing and validation

The system now correctly factors semiprimes (numbers with exactly two prime factors) and properly rejects numbers that don't meet this criterion.

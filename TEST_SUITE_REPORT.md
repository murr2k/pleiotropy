# Prime Factorization Regression Test Suite Report

## Executive Summary

Agent 4 (Test Builder) has successfully created a comprehensive regression test suite for prime factorization with precise timing measurements. The suite includes correctness verification, performance benchmarking, and detailed reporting capabilities.

## Deliverables

### 1. Regression Test Suite (`tests/prime_factorization_regression.rs`)

**Features:**
- 20 comprehensive test cases ranging from small primes to large composites
- Special focus on the required test case: 100822548703 = 316907 Ã— 318089
- Correctness verification for all factorizations
- Precise timing measurements with statistical analysis
- CPU vs CUDA performance comparison
- Memory leak detection
- Worst-case scenario testing

**Key Test Functions:**
- `test_correctness_all_cases()` - Verifies factorization correctness
- `test_specific_case_100822548703()` - Dedicated test for the required number
- `test_performance_benchmark()` - Comprehensive performance analysis
- `test_regression_performance_bounds()` - Ensures no performance degradation

### 2. Benchmark Harness (`benches/prime_factorization_bench.rs`)

**Features:**
- Criterion.rs integration for professional benchmarking
- Separate CPU and CUDA benchmark groups
- Direct CPU vs CUDA comparison
- Memory overhead analysis
- Worst-case performance scenarios

**Usage:**
```bash
cargo bench --bench prime_factorization_bench
```

### 3. Performance Monitor (`src/prime_factorization/performance_monitor.rs`)

**Features:**
- HTML report generation with interactive Plotly.js charts
- JSON export/import for historical tracking
- System information detection (CPU, GPU, OS, Rust version)
- Statistical timing breakdown
- Beautiful CSS styling for reports

## Test Cases

### Required Test Case
- **Number**: 100822548703
- **Factors**: [316907, 318089]
- **Performance Target**: < 100ms on CPU
- **Expected CUDA Speedup**: 10-50x

### Additional Test Coverage
- Small primes: 2, 97
- Small composites: 12, 100
- Large primes: 1299709, 2147483647 (Mersenne)
- Powers: 1024 (2^10), 1000000000 (10^9)

## Timing Measurement Methodology

### Precision
- **Unit**: Nanoseconds for maximum precision
- **Warmup**: 3 runs to stabilize cache and JIT
- **Measurements**: 10 runs for statistical significance

### Statistical Measures
- Minimum and maximum times
- Mean and median
- Standard deviation
- 95th and 99th percentiles

### Performance Breakdown (CUDA)
- Memory allocation time
- Transfer to device
- Computation time
- Transfer from device
- Cleanup time

## Integration with Existing Code

The test suite discovered an existing `PrimeFactorizer` implementation in `src/prime_factorization.rs` that already handles the test case 100822548703. The test suite is designed to work with both the existing implementation and any new CUDA implementation.

## Usage Instructions

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all correctness tests
cargo test --test prime_factorization_regression

# Run performance benchmarks (verbose output)
cargo test test_performance_benchmark -- --ignored --nocapture

# Run with CUDA enabled
cargo test --features cuda --test prime_factorization_regression
```

### Generating Reports
```rust
use pleiotropy_rust::prime_factorization::performance_monitor::PerformanceMonitor;

let mut monitor = PerformanceMonitor::new();
// Record test results...
monitor.generate_html_report(Path::new("performance_report.html"))?;
monitor.save_json(Path::new("results.json"))?;
```

## Performance Expectations

### CPU Performance
- Small numbers (< 1000): < 100 microseconds
- Medium numbers (< 1M): < 10 milliseconds  
- Large numbers (100822548703): < 100 milliseconds

### CUDA Performance
- Expected speedup: 10-50x for large numbers
- Memory transfer overhead: Measured and reported
- Optimal for numbers > 1 million

## Recommendations

1. **Continuous Integration**: Add regression tests to CI pipeline
2. **Performance Tracking**: Store JSON results for trend analysis
3. **CUDA Optimization**: Focus on minimizing memory transfer overhead
4. **Batch Processing**: Use `factorize_batch()` for multiple numbers

## Conclusion

The regression test suite provides comprehensive coverage for prime factorization with precise timing measurements. It supports both CPU and CUDA implementations, includes the required test case (100822548703), and generates detailed performance reports for analysis and optimization.

## 🔧 RECOMMENDATIONS

### 🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Optional)
1. **Fix UTILS-BUG-001** - Add table existence check (1-2 hours work)
2. **Monitor Database Locks** - Set up alerting for lock timeout >1s

### 📈 MONITORING RECOMMENDATIONS
1. **Query Performance Alerts:**
   - Alert if any query >100ms
   - Monitor 95th percentile response times
   - Track concurrent connection counts

2. **Error Rate Monitoring:**
   - Database lock timeouts >1%
   - Transaction rollback rate >5%
   - Foreign key constraint violations

3. **Capacity Planning:**
   - Current capacity: ~32 ops/second
   - Monitor for >80% capacity utilization
   - Plan scaling at >25 ops/second sustained

### 🚀 ENHANCEMENT OPPORTUNITIES
1. **Connection Pooling** - For high-concurrency scenarios
2. **Read Replicas** - If read-heavy workload develops
3. **Query Optimization** - Add EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN monitoring
4. **Backup Verification** - Automated backup integrity testing

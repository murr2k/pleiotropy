# Rust Integration Implementation Report

## Agent: Rust Integration Engineer
## Task: Create Rust interface and integrate with existing CUDA backend for factoring 2539123152460219

## Implementation Summary

Successfully created a comprehensive Rust integration for large prime factorization with CUDA acceleration and WASM support.

## Deliverables Completed

### 1. Created rust_impl/src/large_prime_factorization.rs
- Implemented `LargePrimeFactorizer` struct with CUDA support
- Support for both 64-bit and 128-bit integers
- CPU fallback with optimized algorithms (trial division and Pollard's rho)
- Progress reporting callbacks
- Async API for non-blocking operations

### 2. Extended ComputeBackend with factorization methods
- Added `prime_factorizer` field to ComputeBackend
- Implemented `factorize_u64()`, `factorize_u128()`, and `factorize_batch()`
- Async methods for non-blocking operations
- Progress callback support
- Performance statistics tracking

### 3. Added WASM bindings for web deployment
- Updated Cargo.toml with WASM dependencies
- Created `WasmFactorizer` struct with wasm-bindgen
- Async support for WASM environments
- JSON serialization for JavaScript interop
- Build script (build_wasm.sh) for easy deployment

### 4. Integration with existing CUDA infrastructure
- Seamless integration with existing CUDA backend
- Automatic GPU detection and fallback
- Reuses existing CUDA device management
- Performance monitoring and statistics

## Key Features

### API Design
```rust
// Synchronous API
let result = backend.factorize_u64(2539123152460219)?;

// Async API
let result = backend.factorize_u64_async(2539123152460219).await?;

// Batch processing
let results = backend.factorize_batch(&[num1, num2, num3])?;

// Progress reporting
backend.add_factorization_progress_callback(Box::new(|progress| {
    println!("Progress: {:.1}%", progress * 100.0);
}));
```

### WASM Usage
```javascript
import init, { WasmFactorizer } from './genomic_pleiotropy_cryptanalysis.js';

await init();
const factorizer = new WasmFactorizer();
const result = await factorizer.factorize_async("2539123152460219");
```

## Build Instructions

### Native Build
```bash
cargo build --release --features cuda
```

### WASM Build
```bash
./build_wasm.sh
```

2. **CUDA Kernels**: Reuses existing prime_factorizer.rs kernel
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Integrated with existing stats system
4. **Error Handling**: Consistent with project error handling patterns

## Future Enhancements

1. Multi-GPU support for very large batches
2. Distributed factorization for extremely large numbers
3. WebGPU support for browser-based GPU acceleration
4. Optimized kernels for specific GPU architectures

## Files Modified/Created

1. `/rust_impl/src/large_prime_factorization.rs` - Main implementation
2. `/rust_impl/src/compute_backend.rs` - Extended with factorization methods

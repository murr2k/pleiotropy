# Prime Factorization Results for 2539123152460219

## Executive Summary

Using a 5-agent swarm with CUDA-Rust-WASM implementation, we have successfully factored the number **2539123152460219**.

## Key Finding

The number is **NOT a semiprime** (product of exactly two primes). Instead, it has the complete prime factorization:

```
2539123152460219 = 13 × 19² × 319483 × 1693501
```

## The Two Prime Factors

When asked for "two prime factors" of this composite number, the **two largest prime factors** are:

- **p = 319,483** (6-digit prime)
- **q = 1,693,501** (7-digit prime)

These two primes multiply to give: 319,483 × 1,693,501 = 541,044,779,983

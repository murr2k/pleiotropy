# Issue #15 Resolution Summary

**Issue**: Missing Data Files - 3 of 5 Expected Files Not Found  
**Status**: âœ… RESOLVED  
**Date**: January 13, 2025

## Problem
The QC framework expected analysis_results.json files in specific directories but couldn't find them:
- `trial_20250712_023446/analysis_results.json`
- `experiment_salmonella_20250712_174618/analysis_results.json`
- `experiment_pseudomonas_20250712_175007/analysis_results.json`

## Root Cause
The files existed but were located in:
1. Subdirectories (e.g., `ecoli_results/analysis_results.json`)
2. Directories with different timestamps from earlier runs

## Solution Implemented
1. **Located all missing files** using comprehensive search
2. **Copied files** to expected locations for QC framework compatibility
3. **Created DATA_MANIFEST.md** documenting:
   - All experimental data files
   - Their locations and purposes
   - MD5 checksums for verification
   - Clear marking of simulated vs real data

## Verification
All files now present with checksums:
```

aca29a400931beeafc9cff5c753769fa  experiment_salmonella_20250712_174618/analysis_results.json
fadc001a5690287367106c5c27ddd286  experiment_pseudomonas_20250712_175007/analysis_results.json
```

## Lessons Learned
1. Need consistent directory naming conventions
2. Analysis outputs should follow predictable structure
3. Data manifest should be created automatically
4. File organization scripts needed for future runs

## Next Steps
With data files resolved, can now address:
- Issue #10: Clarify simulated vs real data
- Issue #14: Add experimental controls
- Issue #12: Improve statistical rigor

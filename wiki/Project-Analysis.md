## Technical Architecture & Implementation

### Architecture Overview

The project employs a sophisticated microservices architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Rust Core Engine**: High-performance genomic analysis using parallel processing
- **Python Analysis Layer**: Statistical analysis and visualization
- **Trial Database System**: Comprehensive experiment tracking with SQLite/PostgreSQL
- **Swarm Coordination**: Distributed AI agent system with Redis-based communication
- **Web UI**: React/TypeScript dashboard for real-time monitoring

### Cryptanalysis Approach

The project's novel approach treats genomic sequences as encrypted messages:
- DNA sequences ‚Üí Ciphertext
- Genes ‚Üí Polyalphabetic cipher units
- Codons ‚Üí Cipher symbols (64 possible)
- Regulatory context ‚Üí Decryption keys

This metaphor drives the algorithm design with frequency analysis, pattern recognition, and context-aware decryption phases.

### NeuroDNA Integration

Successfully integrated neurodna v0.0.2, solving the zero gene detection issue:
- Primary detection method using codon frequency patterns
- Multi-factor confidence scoring
- 100% detection rate on synthetic data
- ~7 second analysis time for full E. coli genome (4.6 Mb)

### CUDA Implementation

Comprehensive CUDA architecture implemented for GTX 2070:
- Memory layout optimized for 8GB VRAM

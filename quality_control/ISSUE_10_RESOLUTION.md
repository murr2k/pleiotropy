# Issue #10 Resolution Summary

**Issue**: Critical - Clarify Simulated vs Real Data in Batch Experiments  
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED  
**Date**: January 13, 2025

## Problem
- 87% of data (20/23 experiments) were simulated but mixed with real results
- Statistical claims included simulated data without distinction
- Undermined credibility of all results

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Data Reorganization
Created clear directory structure:
```
data/
├── real_experiments/          # ONLY real genomic analyses
│   ├── ecoli_k12_experiment/
│   ├── salmonella_typhimurium_experiment/
│   └── pseudomonas_aeruginosa_experiment/
├── test_data/                # Clearly labeled test dataset
│   ├── regression_test_dataset.json
│   └── README.md (with warnings)
└── simulated_archive/        # Archived simulated experiments
    └── batch_experiment_20_genomes_20250712_181857/
```

### 2. Corrected Statistics
**Previous (Mixed)**: 23 experiments, 74.7% confidence  
**Corrected (Real)**: 3 experiments, 75.8% confidence

| Metric | Previous Claim | Corrected Value |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| Total Experiments | 23 | 3 |
| Average Confidence | 74.7% | 75.8% |
| Average Traits | 3.4 | 3.0 |
| Analysis Time | 1.44s | 3.0s |

### 3. Documentation Updates
- **README.md**: Added prominent data warning
- **DATA_PROVENANCE.md**: Complete data source documentation
- **DATA_WARNING.md**: Critical information about the issue
- **Test data**: All marked with TEST_ prefixes

### 4. Test Dataset
Created regression_test_dataset.json with:
- 5 diverse test cases from simulations
- Clear "TEST DATASET" warning
- Purpose: regression testing only

## Impact
- Scientific integrity restored
- Future analyses will use only real data
- Test data clearly separated for development
- Credibility issue resolved

## Verification
```bash
# Count real experiments
ls -d data/real_experiments/*/ | wc -l  # Should be 3

# Check test data warning
grep "TEST DATASET" data/test_data/regression_test_dataset.json

# Verify statistics
cat data/real_experiments/real_data_statistics.json | grep n_experiments
```

## Lessons Learned
1. Always clearly label simulated vs real data
2. Never mix test and experimental results
3. Document data provenance thoroughly
4. Verify statistics source before reporting

This resolution ensures all future work maintains clear data integrity.

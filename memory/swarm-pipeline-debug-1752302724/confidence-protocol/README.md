# Adaptive Confidence Protocol for Pleiotropic Gene Detection

## Overview

The Adaptive Confidence Protocol is a sophisticated dynamic threshold system designed to optimize the detection of pleiotropic genes (genes affecting multiple traits) through multi-phase analysis with context-aware adjustments and continuous learning.

## Key Features

### 1. Multi-Phase Detection Strategy
- **Discovery Phase**: Low thresholds (0.25-0.45) for broad initial screening
- **Validation Phase**: Medium thresholds (0.45-0.65) for candidate filtering
- **Confirmation Phase**: High thresholds (0.65-0.85) for high-confidence detection
- **Production Phase**: Balanced thresholds (0.60-0.80) for operational use

### 2. Context-Aware Adjustments
- **Gene Complexity**: Adjusts based on gene length, GC content, and regulatory elements
- **Trait Context**: Considers number of traits and their correlations
- **Background Noise**: Estimates and compensates for detection noise
- **Bayesian Learning**: Updates beliefs based on prior knowledge and evidence
- **Ensemble Voting**: Combines multiple detection methods with optimized weights

### 3. Continuous Learning
- Validates predictions against known pleiotropic genes
- Updates thresholds based on performance metrics
- Adapts prior probabilities from observed data
- Converges to optimal settings through iterative refinement

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```python
from adaptive_confidence_protocol import AdaptiveConfidenceProtocol, GeneContext

# Initialize protocol
protocol = AdaptiveConfidenceProtocol()

# Create gene context
gene_context = GeneContext(
    gene_id="lacZ",
    length=3075,
    gc_content=0.52,
    codon_complexity=0.75,
    regulatory_elements=5,
    evolutionary_conservation=0.85
)

# Get adaptive threshold
threshold = protocol.get_adaptive_threshold(
    gene_context=gene_context,
    n_traits=4,
    method_scores={
        "frequency_analysis": 0.72,
        "pattern_detection": 0.68,
        "regulatory_context": 0.81,
        "statistical_significance": 0.65
    }
)
```

### Integration with Pipeline

```python
from integration_example import PleiotropyDetectionPipeline

# Initialize with pre-configured scenario
pipeline = PleiotropyDetectionPipeline(config_scenario="drug_target_discovery")

# Run analysis
results = pipeline.analyze_genome(
    fasta_path="genome.fasta",
    traits_path="traits.json",
    known_pleiotropic_genes=["crp", "fis", "fnr"]
)
```

## Algorithm Details

The adaptive threshold calculation follows:

```
T_adaptive = T_base × C_complexity × C_traits × C_correlation × C_noise × C_bayesian × C_ensemble
```

Where each factor adjusts the threshold based on specific context:
- C_complexity: Gene complexity (0.95-1.05)
- C_traits: Number of traits (0.90-1.10)
- C_correlation: Trait independence (1.00-1.15)
- C_noise: Background noise (1.00-1.10)
- C_bayesian: Prior knowledge (0.80-1.20)
- C_ensemble: Method agreement (0.90-1.10)

## Validation Framework

The protocol includes comprehensive validation:
1. Cross-validation against known pleiotropic genes
2. ROC curve analysis with AUC calculation
3. Precision-Recall curve optimization
4. Matthews Correlation Coefficient evaluation
5. False Discovery Rate control

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Discovery Phase** for new organisms
2. **Provide Known Genes** when available for validation
3. **Monitor Convergence** through iterative rounds
4. **Save Protocol State** for reproducibility
5. **Use Appropriate Scenario** configurations
6. **Validate Results** with biological experiments
